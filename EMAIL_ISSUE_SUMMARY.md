# Email Issue - Summary & Solution

## The Problem

You're getting this error when using the forgot password feature:
```
"Failed to send password reset email. Please contact support."
```

## Root Cause

Your `backend/.env` file has **placeholder email credentials** instead of real ones:
- `EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com` ← This is a placeholder
- `EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_16_char_app_password` ← This is a placeholder

Also, there was a bug in the code: `createTransporter` should be `createTransport` (now fixed ✅)

## The Solution (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Get Gmail App Password

1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Enable "2-Step Verification" (required)
3. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
4. Generate new App Password for "Mail"
5. Copy the 16-character password (example: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

### Step 2: Update .env File

Edit `backend/.env` and replace with YOUR real credentials:

```env
EMAIL_USER=your.real.email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=abcdefghijklmnop
```

**Important:** 
- Remove spaces from the App Password
- Use your ACTUAL Gmail address
- Use the App Password (NOT your regular Gmail password)

### Step 3: Restart Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

## Verify the Fix

Test your configuration:

```bash
cd backend
node test-email-config.js
```

Expected output:
```
✅ Connection SUCCESSFUL!
Email service is properly configured.
```

## Test Forgot Password

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/login
2. Click "Forgot Password?"
3. Enter your email
4. Click "Send Reset Link"
5. Check your email inbox
6. You should receive the password reset email!

## Why App Password?

Google requires App Passwords for security when apps access Gmail:
- Regular passwords don't work with SMTP anymore
- 2-Step Verification must be enabled first
- App Passwords are 16-character codes generated by Google
- They're more secure than using your regular password

## Files Updated

- ✅ Fixed `backend/src/utils/emailService.js` (createTransporter → createTransport)
- ✅ Created `backend/test-email-config.js` (test script)
- ✅ Created `FIX_EMAIL_ISSUE.md` (detailed guide)

## Quick Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `node test-email-config.js` | Test email configuration |
| `npm start` | Restart backend server |
| `npm run dev` | Restart in dev mode |
