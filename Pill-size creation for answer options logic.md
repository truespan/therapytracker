Discard the current logic and recreate option length creation logic based on the following conditions:
1.Keeping the answer options length uniform is highest priority for individual questions.
2.Avoid creating ellipsis by increasing pill length if this can be done without creating horizontal scroll.
3.Next priority is avoid creating horizontal scroll if we can accomodate options with creating ellipsis for maximum one answer option.
4.When there are more than one answer option getting ellipsis, create horizontal scroll to avoid ellipsis.
5.Even after creating horizontal scroll, if more than one option get ellipsis, avoid ellipsis by creating double line text.
6.Double line answer options are last priority.
